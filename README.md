#ExcelAnt

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Wisembly/ExcelAnt.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Wisembly/ExcelAnt)

ExcelAnt is an Excel manipulation library for PHP 5.4. It currently works on top of [PHPExcel](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PHPExcel).
If you want to add / use another library, feel free to fork and contribute !

#Installation

1. Install composer : `curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php`
(more info at getcomposer.org)
2. Create a `composer.json` file in your project root :
(or add only the excelant line in your existing composer file)

```yml
  {
    "require": {
      "wisembly/excelant": "dev-master",
    }
  }
```

3. Install via composer : `php composer.phar install`

#Use ExcelAnt

Create a simple Table :

```php
use ExcelAnt\Adapter\PhpExcel\Workbook\Workbook,
    ExcelAnt\Adapter\PhpExcel\Sheet\Sheet,
    ExcelAnt\Adapter\PhpExcel\Writer\Writer,
    ExcelAnt\Table\Table,
    ExcelAnt\Coordinate\Coordinate;

Class Export
{
    public function createExport(array $users)
    {
        $workbook = new Workbook();
        $sheet = new Sheet($workbook);
        $table = new Table();

        foreach ($users as $user) {
            $table->setRow([
                $user->getName(),
                $user->getEmail(),
            ]);
        }

        $sheet->addTable($table, new Coordinate(1, 1));
        $workbook->addSheet($sheet);
    }
}
```

Now, to export your Workbook, you need to create a Writer :

```php
use ExcelAnt\Adapter\PhpExcel\Writer\Worker\StyleWorker,
    ExcelAnt\Adapter\PhpExcel\Writer\Worker\CellWorker,
    ExcelAnt\Adapter\PhpExcel\Writer\Worker\LabelWorker,
    ExcelAnt\Adapter\PhpExcel\Writer\Worker\TableWorker,
    ExcelAnt\Adapter\PhpExcel\Writer\PhpExcelWriter\Excel5;

$styleWorker = new StyleWorker();
$cellWorker = new CellWorker($styleWorker);
$labelWorker = new LabelWorker($cellWorker);
$tableWorker = new TableWorker($cellWorker, $labelWorker);

$writer = new Writer(new Excel5('myExport.xls'), $tableWorker, $cellWorker, $styleWorker);
```

Convert your Worbook to create a PHPExcel object and export it :

```php
$phpExcel = $writer->convert($workbook);
$writer->write($phpExcel);
```
